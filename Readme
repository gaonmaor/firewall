There are two new protections (SQL Injection and zabbix)
The new protections are been activated as extended flags to /sys/class/fw5/fw5_rules/config
The new flags are:
FW_CONFIG_SQL_PROTECT1	 	= 0x40,
FW_CONFIG_SQL_PROTECT2	 	= 0x80,
FW_CONFIG_ZABBIX		= 0x100

To activate zabbix use 0x100 flag, note that zabbix depends also on ACTIVE flag, TCP flag and Connection Track to be active.
After activating this protection, for example by writing echo 309 > /sys/class/fw5/fw5_rules/config, the protection is active. (309 is active + tcp + connection table + accept rule + zabbix)
The protection should drop zabbix attacks as described by the CR.

The SQL Injection has for mods: disabled, low, medium and high. if both of the flags are off, SQL Injection protection is disabled,
If only protect1 flag is on - the protection is in low mode, protect 2 - medium and both for high.
Each protection level has deferent thresholds to support deferent levels of SQL Injection protections.

Examples:
echo 117 > /sys/class/fw5/fw5_rules/config, the protection is active. (309 is active + tcp + connection table + accept rule + protect1)
echo 181 > /sys/class/fw5/fw5_rules/config, the protection is active. (309 is active + tcp + connection table + accept rule + protect2)
echo 245 > /sys/class/fw5/fw5_rules/config, the protection is active. (309 is active + tcp + connection table + accept rule + protect1 + protect2)
echo 373 > /sys/class/fw5/fw5_rules/config, the protection is active. (309 is active + tcp + connection table + accept rule + protect1 + zabbix) - Should be caught by zabbix because protect1 made so to miss the protection.
